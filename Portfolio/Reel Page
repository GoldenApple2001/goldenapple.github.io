My song "Off Track" was made in April of 2021 and released in June of that same year. It instantly became an overnight sensation, reaching 10K views in just under a day. You can find it here at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0zHEoEp8Uo&list=OLAK5uy_kda_qljFsqYNkSe5QHOPjqiwkUnP3BfPo
My song "Lights Out" was made in July 2020 and released in June 2021. It wasn't an overnight sensation like the other one was, but it did end up making it onto iHeartRadio one night, which gained it even more attention than "Off Track" as it was heard by multiple people all around the DMV at the same time.
